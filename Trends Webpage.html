<p><b>Artificial Intelligence(AI)</b> - AI is undoubtedly one of the biggest tech trends at the moment, and during 2021 it will become an even more valuable tool for helping us to interpret and understand the world around us. The volume of data we are collecting on healthcare, infection rates, and the success of measures we take to prevent the spread of infection will continue to increase. This means that machine learning algorithms will become better informed and increasingly sophisticated in the solutions they uncover for us. For business, the challenge will be to understand the changing patterns of customer behavior. More human activity will take place online – from shopping and socializing to virtual working environments, meetings, and recruitment. During 2021 we can expect the tools we use to analyze these behavioral shifts to become more sophisticated and increasingly fit the budget and infrastructure requirements of more and more organizations.</p>

<p><b>5G Implementation</b> - 2020 was the pilot year when 5G systems landed in Canada. However, the connection is spotty, and currently, only three carriers offer the technology in the country. In 2021, four new carriers are set to introduce it, and this will help 5G enter the broader market.With 5G, customers and businesses will be able to use faster downloading speeds to connect instantaneously. Plus, it will increase the productivity of workers and make Canadian companies more competitive on a global scale.5G networks promise to be 20 times faster than the current 4G systems, so faster download speeds, less lag time and a more stable connection are expected. In 2021, not only will this increase the speed of businesses, but it can also revolutionize the way businesses operate and interact with customers.The business world is always changing, and business owners need to be constantly on the lookout for new opportunities. By incorporating the above three trends into a business plan, business owners will arm themselves with knowledge and ensure they’re at the cutting edge of business practices.</p>

<p><b>Anywhere Operations</b> - An anywhere operations model will be vital for businesses to emerge successfully from COVID-19. At its core, this operating model allows for business to be accessed, delivered and enabled anywhere — where customers, employers and business partners operate in physically remote environments. The model for anywhere operations is “digital first, remote first;” for example, banks that are mobile-only, but handle everything from transferring funds to opening accounts with no physical interaction. Digital should be the default at all times. That’s not to say physical space doesn’t have its place, but it should be digitally enhanced, for example, contactless check-out at a physical store, regardless of whether its physical or digital capabilities should be seamlessly delivered.</p>
