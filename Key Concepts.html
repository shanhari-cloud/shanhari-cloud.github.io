<h1>Key Concepts</h1>
<hr />
<p><b>
1) Networking</b>: Network can be defined as a group of computers and other devices connected in some ways so as to be able to exchange data. Networking means connecting computers so that they can share files, printers, applications, and other computer-related resources.
Main types of networks are LAN and WANs. LAN stands for local area network and WAN stands for wide area network. LAN can range from workstation, home office connected to printer in common areas. WAN connects computers over a wide area, such as from region to region or even continent to continent. Common computer terms discussed in computer networking are IP address, router, nodes, switches and port. The internet is the largest WAN, connecting billions of computers worldwide.
There are many advantages in networking. 
1. Facility of Technical Support 
2. Easy data, software, hardware sharing
3. Easy to communicate
4. Easy to centralize or decentralize the project.

<p><b>2) Programming</b>: Programming is a way to instruct/tell a computer to perform a specific       task/solve a problem. Programming can be used in making games, software to give command, application, predicting stuff for future. Every application in the phone, computer or any device needs a program to run. Programmers use a programming language or program development tool to create computer programs. Popular programming languages include C++, Java, JavaScript, Visual (Morley). The programming process: 
1. Defining the problem
2. Planning the solution
3.Coding the program
4.Testing the program
5.Documenting the program


<p><b>3) Information System</b>: Information system is the combination of hardware, software, data, people and procedures. People in the information technology department develop procedures for processing data. Following these procedures, people use hardware and software to enter the data into a computer. Software processes the data and directs the computer hardware to store changes on storage media and produce information in desired form (Morley). The world is all about information systems from the government to small businesses. How many big companies entirely depend on information systems examples. Amazon, Alibaba, ebay. There are many types of information systems, depending on the need they are designed to fill. An operations support system, such as a transaction processing system.

<p><b>4) Operating System</b>:  An operating system is a set of programs that coordinates all the activities among computer hardware devices. Many of today’s computers use Microsoft’s Windows, Mac OS operating system (Morley). Operating system loads a program into the computer's memory, offers a user interface, coordinates how the program works with hardware and other software. There are few types of operating system: 1. Real time operating system 2. Single tasking operating system 3. Multitasking operating system. 


<p><b>5) Cybersecurity</b>: The activity can be defined as the defending of computers, servers,
mobile devises, electronic systems, networks and data from digital attack. The goal of
implementing cybersecurity is to provide a good security posture for computers servers
network and mobile devices. Cyber-attack is very common now , it can be designed to
access, delete or extort an organization. The attack is divided into different categories
such as network security and application security and information security. From
government to house all protect these malicious attacks in different ways. Mostly these
attacks are regulated through different mediums such as malware which includes virus,
trojans, spyware and etc. Cyber security face many challenges.
Cyber security is important to protect the data on computers and other devices.
